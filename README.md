## Error Handling

The application includes a middleware for handling unknown endpoints:

```js
const unknownEndpoint = (request, response) => {
  response.status(404).send({ error: "unknown endpoint" });
};

app.use(unknownEndpoint);
```

This will send a 404 error for any requests that do not match the defined routes.

## Middleware

The application uses a custom middleware for authentication. The middleware verifies the access token in the request headers and attaches the user ID to the request object if the token is valid.

## Dependencies

The application uses several npm packages:

- `express`: For creating the server and handling HTTP requests and responses.
- `cors`: For handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- `jsonwebtoken`: For creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
- `mongoose`: For modeling and mapping MongoDB data to javascript.
- `multer`: For handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files.
- `bcrypt`: For hashing passwords.
- `nodemailer`: For sending emails.
- `dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
- `archiver`: For archiving and extracting zip files.
- `nodemon`: For automatically restarting the server whenever file changes are detected in the directory.
